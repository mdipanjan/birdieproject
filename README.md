===================================
===================================
I found this design on dribble and tried to 
implent it accordingly. The original design is 
made by https://dribbble.com/Sochnik. 
This one is for practice purpose only.
The animations are created with the help of Anime.js (http://animejs.com/)
and this initial page is not responsive , only 
created for the esktop version. I'll surely make 
it mobile friendly soon.
See the live demo here :
